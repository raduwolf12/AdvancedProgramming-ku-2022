Submission:
===========

  + No packaging/building issues.

  + No significant compiler warnings or style hints from OnlineTA.

    = But take a close look at them; they are mostly very sensible.

  - You have no report.


Let It Be - Code
================

+ General style issues: fine

= Generators: OK, but with a few problems

    - You are using random strings as variables. As such this is
      correct, however it is unlikely that you'll generate interesting
      expressions because the space of possible variable a too
      big. Try to constrain variable be a one lower-case letter, for
      instance, or one of x, y or z.
      
    + Your expression generator is clearly written an easy to
      understand.
      
- Properties: problems

    - You should not outcomment failing properties, but rather state why they
      fail.

- You have not fixed the mistake in the simplifier, or implemented the
  extensions.
  The purpose was to use qc to find the mistake, and then fix it :)


Mystery - code
==============

- It looks like you did not implement this part.


Overall score: 0 / 6
  I am afraid this assignment cannot be passed. If you need some help
  understanding the assignment or quickcheck, ask your TA in the TA session
  after the break :)
