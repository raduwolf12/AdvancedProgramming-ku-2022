Submission:
===========

  + No packaging/building issues.

  + No significant compiler warnings or style hints from OnlineTA.

    = But take a close look at them; they are mostly very sensible.

  - Your report document should be called exactly `report.pdf`, as
    specified in the assignment text and submission instructions.

  - Your KU-ID should be visible in the report.

  - Please remember to include listings of your code as an appendix in
    the report.

Emoji - code:

  + Warmup: fine

    - Your `wait` is extremely slow because it runs in a loop instead of
      sleeping while waiting for receiving the result. The latter would not
      take up CPU hours because of intelligent engineering of the Erlang
      runtime. In conclusion, it is better for the server to store a list of
      waiting processes and contact them when the computation has completed.

  - General style issues: some problems.

    - Problem: You have essentially no separation of concerns in your
      code. The code for the communication part and the "business
      logic" is all tangled together. Try to split the looping
      function into two functions a `handle` function that's purely
      functional and a `loop` that only manage the communication part.

    - You use a list where a map would be a more appropriate data
      structure.

  - I think the reason that you get timeouts is that you have not implemented
    the most important command, namely `lookup`.

Emoji - Testing:

  - No tests at all (other than the default ones). That's not
    acceptable: merely passing (most or all) the OnlineTA tests is not a
    substitute for doing and documenting your own tests, and in
    particular, there will _not_ be an OnlineTA for the final exam
    (except perhaps for a rudimentary version checking that your code
    builds and runs on a trivial example).

Emoji server - Report:

  = Rather minimal overview of main design/implementation choices.

    - You have not explained how many processes your solution uses

  - No real assessment or summary of testing results.

  - You say that you have $O(n^2)$ memory efficiency. First of all, what $n$ is
    not explained. I suppose it is the number of emojis. If so, then where does
    this exponent $2$ come from?

Overall score: 1 / 6

Because large parts of the core functionality (lookups, analytics functions)
and testing is not done, I have to fail you without resubmission. Best of luck
with the assignments to come. Max.
